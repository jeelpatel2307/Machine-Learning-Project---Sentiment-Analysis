# Sentiment Analysis with NLTK

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. The sentiment analysis model is trained on the movie reviews dataset to classify text as either positive or negative.

## Project Structure

### 1. `sentiment_analysis.py`

- Contains the main code for sentiment analysis.
- Utilizes NLTK to download the movie reviews dataset and train a Naive Bayes classifier.
- Defines functions for feature extraction, training the classifier, and predicting sentiment.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `sentiment_analysis.py`.
2. Run the program using the command:
    
    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    
    ```
    

## Usage

1. The program downloads the movie reviews dataset and trains a sentiment analysis classifier.
2. The accuracy of the classifier on the test set is displayed.
3. You can test the classifier with custom text to predict sentiment.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project based on your requirements. You can explore more advanced sentiment analysis techniques, use larger datasets, or integrate the model into a real-world application.
